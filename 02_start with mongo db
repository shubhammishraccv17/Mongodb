A document is the basic unit of data for MongoDB and is roughly equivalent to a
row in a relational database management system

a collection can be thought of as a table with a dynamic schema.

A single instance of MongoDB can host multiple independent databases, each of
which can have its own collections.


documents an ordered set of keys with associated values

{"red":"hello ,Shubham"}
{"blue":"good morning ","pink"=3}
 
in document Keys are strings that can have any utf charecter with some exceptions

  • Keys must not contain the character \0 (the null character). This character is used
      to signify the end of a key.
   • The . and $ characters have some special properties and should be used only in
  certain circumstances, as described in later chapters. In general, they should be
  considered reserved, and drivers will complain if they are used inappropriately.
  
   MongoDB is type-sensitive and case-sensitive. For example, these documents are
distinct:


it cannot have duplicate keys 


collection -- it is a group of  documents


dynamic schemas
